This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Currently hosted at: [My GitHub Pages](https://stpetar.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/)

This project is a way for me to get familiar with Web development and mainly HTML, CSS, JS and popular Web dev frameworks



## Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm
### Guarantees shortest path

## Currently working on A* visualization
### Guarantees shortest path
This will take some refactoring as I will need to add a direction towards which each node is facing to calculate the **cheapest** path to the end node

## TODO
* Add a way to change start and end point
* Show which way current node from shortest path is facing for visualization clarity
* Add further algorithms
